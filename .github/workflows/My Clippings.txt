If you select the wrong materials, the wrong textbooks, the wrong instructions, it does not matter how hard you tried. You could end up acquiring wrong ideas and bad techniques, which is probably one of the worst-case scenarios in learning. Bad habits are stubborn and very hard to get rid of. In this sense, material beats method.

At death, the body finishes but the mind continues into the next life, just as when the previous life died, the mind continued into this life. The process is called mental continuity, reincarnation or rebirth. Ordinary beings undergo this process without control. Advanced meditation practitioners can control it and choose their rebirth.

The Dalai Lama has said that all the essence of the Buddha’s teachings can be summarized in the phrase, “If you can’t help others, at least don’t harm them.” This shows the basic practice is to not harm any living being and, if possible, on that basis to help others as much as possible and relieve suffering. Suffering can be traced back to the mind, with fundamental ignorance at its root. Therefore, ultimately, the best

One of the key Buddhist concepts is that of interdependence. Nothing exists by itself in a vacuum; humans and all other beings and the environment are inextricably interrelated. Whatever people do to the environment will inevitably affect them. Because the mind is so dependent upon the body, and the body is in turn dependent upon its surroundings, the world must be taken care of.

Our astrological blueprint (also called a natal chart), acts similarly to our DNA. Though we are born with certain things encoded in our DNA, our life, experiences, attitude, and condition all influence the expression of this inherited structure.

Like DNA, our astrological blueprint shows us our tendencies. It reveals where our strengths and weaknesses lie, and learning about them gives us the opportunity to enhance or soften them based on our choices. Though we are “born with it,” our astrological imprint does not determine our destiny. Astrology shows us what kind of energy we were born with (usually thought of as the soul’s agreement; what our soul said “yes” to working with in this lifetime).

This by no means places us in the role of the victim of our circumstances. Far from it, when we see our historical markers, then, as the saying goes, “hindsight is 20/20.” We see perfectly that everything was exactly as it needed to be to optimize our soul’s growth and bring us to where we are today. That, in addition to knowing our habits, patterns and tendencies through our astrological blueprint, gives us clues as to how to soften our karma, dull the sharp edges of our personality, look out for pitfalls in our interactions, and most importantly: how to mine our own shadow for the gold of the self-knowledge that we seek.

However, during the Enlightenment period of the 17th & 18th centuries, the schism between astrology and astronomy arose. Prior to this time, there was no separation of the two, and the movement of the heavens was the movement of the divine. Astrology was a system for man to understand and speak with divinity, to commune with it, and even to more thoroughly align with it. The Enlightenment period, however, stripped spirit from matter in all forms. Alchemy became chemistry, for example. And, astronomy became favored over astrology for its more advanced more “scientific” viewpoint.

In modern times, we see a major shift in astrology, however. It is now focused on the individual. Historically, astrology was only used for major cultural events. Around 100 or so years ago (around the same time as the industrial revolution), our culture shifts into a focus on the individual. We became more concerned about our own welfare and well-being than the culture’s. This sparks a shift in the application of astrology, too!

The first is that the planets have some kind of pull on us as humans… energetic or gravitational. The effect of that pull is the impression the planet has on our personality and unique makeup. Given each planet has a particular energetic signature, we can then measure the effects of its pull through the astrological imprint.

each planet can be thought of as a hand on a clock. When we look at a clock, the hands tell us the time. It’s 3 o’clock when the big hand points up, and the little hand points left. The hands themselves aren’t time, they are simply indicators of time. In the same way, through careful observation, astrologers throughout history have charted that when a planet sits at a certain position, it indicates a certain force of energy on the planet, on an individual, or on a society.

Oftentimes you will be able to explain something related to the idea that you already understand. However, eventually you will reach a stopping point where you can’t explain. Congratulations, you have identified the missing link, the knowledge gap that you need to fill. It is time to do some research and close the gap.

We learn more about how our core wounds and behaviors express themselves...and so we know how to better resolve them. In that moment that our moon sign finds its reactivity, we find our strength by feeling its call and going deep within. This allows us to be more conscious of our reactions and read the signs of what a situation or person triggers within us. Too much wounding from a particular situation is a good sign to remove yourself from it.

The sun sign is the ego, which is just one (powerfully compelling) part of the conscious mind. Sometimes the ego is so strong we forget about everything else that exists within us...we feel our emotions and triggers (from our moon) as if we are a victim of them. And, we fail to recognize that we are bigger than our usually narrow-minded ego allows us to believe. When we forget how powerful we are, we ignore the traits of our rising sign.

When we step out of the light of our ascendant, we become unnecessarily fearful, we cling to our smallness  and become so attached to our small view of ourselves and life we staunchly defend it. However, when we step into the light, we give rise to the fullest expression of ourselves encoded in our natal chart. We know unequivocally who we are and establish an unshakable sense of self. There is no rift between who we know ourselves to be and who we are because we have knowledge of the self; we are completely authentic.

We also discern light from the dark in our life by knowing how to encourage the high-side expression of our astrological traits, and recognize when we succumb to the low-side. One of the most powerful skills we cultivate as mystics is the power of discernment--the ability to consistently make choices that help us lean toward the light.

Life is really very beautiful, it is not this ugly thing that we have made of it; and you can appreciate its richness, its depth, its extraordinary loveliness only when you revolt against everything - against organized religion, against tradition, against the present rotten society - so that you as a human being find out for yourself what is true. Not to imitate but to discover - that is education, is it not? It is very easy to conform to what your society or your parents and teachers tell you. That is a safe and easy way of existing; but that is not living, because in it there is fear, decay, death. To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself.

We must create immediately an atmosphere of freedom so that you can live and find out for yourselves what is true, so that you become intelligent, so that you are able to face the world and understand it, not just conform to it, so that inwardly, deeply, psychologically you are in constant revolt; because it is only those who are in constant revolt that discover what is true, not the man who conforms, who follows some tradition. It is only when you are constantly inquiring, constantly observing, constantly learning, that you find truth, God, or love; and you cannot inquire, observe, learn, you cannot be deeply aware, if you are afraid. So the function of education, surely, is to eradicate, inwardly as well as outwardly, this fear that destroys human thought, human relationship and love.

But for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power, and so are legitimate objects of desire.

Seneca and Marcus Aurelius had selected Stoic philosophy as the most adequate system for expressing their existential problems of independence, solitude, and history. In this enterprise, Seneca made tremendous strides toward the insights of social psychology as a by-product of his consciousness of decadence (in this he was close to Nietzsche), but he was not primarily concerned with the unity of the Stoic system. Marcus Aurelius changed the philosophical doctrine into the regimen of the lonesome ruler. In contrast to both, Epictetus was teaching Stoic philosophy as a doctrine and as a way of life. The Enchiridion is a summary of theoretical and applied Stoicism.

Discourses are a living image of the teacher in action; they present the process of philosophizing, not the finished product. They show the enthusiastic and sober, the realistic and pathetic moralist in constantly changing perspectives determined by the changing students with their various concerns, problems, and questions; his teachings, his formulations, have direct reference to the various life situations in which the students should apply and practice the master’s Stoic teaching. No human situation is omitted; as a guide to conduct, philosophy has relevance for all. Whether the students have to attend a dinner party, whether they are among competitors in a stadium or in a swimming pool, whether they have to present themselves at court or in an office, whether they are in the company of their mothers and sisters or of girl friends, in all human situations the philosopher knows the correct advice for the philosophical apprentice. Thus, in the Discourses, Arrian presents the unique individuality of the philosopher and of his applied moral method in living contact with various students in concrete situations. Epictetus as teacher anticipates very modern educational methods in his regard for the structure of situations and the changing perspectives in human relationships.

Not in our power are all the elements which constitute our environment, such as wealth, health, reputation, social prestige, power, the lives of those we love, and death. In our power are our thinking, our intentions, our desires, our decisions. These make it possible for us to control ourselves and to make of ourselves elements and parts of the universe of nature. This knowledge of ourselves makes us free in a world of dependencies. This superiority of our powers enables us to live in conformity with nature.

Knowing one’s emotions. Self-awareness—recognizing a feeling as it happens—is the keystone of emotional intelligence. As we will see in Chapter 4, the ability to monitor feelings from moment to moment is crucial to psychological insight and self-understanding. An inability to notice our true feelings leaves us at their mercy. People with greater certainty about their feelings are better pilots of their lives, having a surer sense of how they really feel about personal decisions from whom to marry to what job to take.

Emotional self-control— delaying gratification and stifling impulsiveness—underlies accomplishment of every sort.

Empathy, another ability that builds on emotional self-awareness, is the fundamental “people skill.” Chapter 7 will investigate the roots of empathy, the social cost of being emotionally tone-deaf, and the reason empathy kindles altruism. People who are empathic are more attuned to the subtle social signals that indicate what others need or want. This makes them better at callings such as the caring professions, teaching, sales, and management.

Those who tune in under duress can, by the very act of attending so carefully, unwittingly amplify the magnitude of their own reactions—especially if their tuning in is devoid of the equanimity of self-awareness. The result is that their emotions seem all the more intense. Those who tune out, who distract themselves, notice less about their own reactions, and so minimize the experience of their emotional response, if not the size of the response itself

The goal is balance, not emotional suppression: every feeling has its value and significance. A life without passion would be a dull wasteland of neutrality, cut off and isolated from the richness of life itself. But, as Aristotle observed, what is wanted is appropriate emotion, feeling proportionate to circumstance. When emotions are too muted they create dullness and distance; when out of control, too extreme and persistent, they become pathological, as in immobilizing depression, overwhelming anxiety, raging anger, manic agitation.

In short, unflappableness is a kind of upbeat denial, a positive dissociation—and, possibly, a clue to neural mechanisms at play in the more severe dissociative states that can occur in, say, posttraumatic stress disorder.

To the degree that our emotions get in the way of or enhance our ability to think and plan, to pursue training for a distant goal, to solve problems and the like, they define the limits of our capacity to use our innate mental abilities, and so determine how we do in life. And to the degree to which we are motivated by feelings of enthusiasm and pleasure in what we do—or even by an optimal degree of anxiety— they propel us to accomplishment. It is in this sense that emotional intelligence is a master aptitude, a capacity that profoundly affects all other abilities, either facilitating or interfering with them.

Being able to enter flow is emotional intelligence at its best; flow represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in the service of performance and learning. In flow the emotions are not just contained and channeled, but positive, energized, and aligned with the task at hand. To be caught in the ennui of depression or the agitation of anxiety is to be barred from flow.

Flow is a state of self-forgetfulness, the opposite of rumination and worry: instead of being lost in nervous preoccupation, people in flow are so absorbed in the task at hand that they lose all selfconsciousness, dropping the small preoccupations—health, bills, even doing well—of daily life. In this sense moments of flow are egoless. Paradoxically, people in flow exhibit a masterly control of what they are doing, their responses perfectly attuned to the changing demands of the task

There are several ways to enter flow. One is to intentionally focus a sharp attention on the task at hand; a highly concentrated state is the essence of flow. There seems to be a feedback loop at the gateway to this zone: it can require considerable effort to get calm and focused enough to begin the task—this first step takes some discipline. But once focus starts to lock in, it takes on a force of its own, both offering relief from emotional turbulence and making the task effortless.

They also watch videotapes of victims tearfully telling what it was like to be molested. The offenders then write about their own offense from the victim’s point of view, imagining what the victim felt. They read this account to a therapy group, and try to answer questions about the assault from the victim’s perspective.

The slowness of men to bring up problems in a relationship is no doubt compounded by their relative lack of skill when it comes to reading facial expressions of emotions. Women, for example, are more sensitive to a sad expression on a man’s face than are men in detecting sadness from a woman’s expression.11 Thus a woman has to be all the sadder for a man to notice her feelings in the first place, let alone for him to raise the question of what is making her so sad.

Most couples have moments like this from time to time, where a complaint about something a partner has done is voiced as an attack against the person rather than the deed. But these harsh personal criticisms have a far more corrosive emotional impact than do more reasoned complaints. And such attacks, perhaps understandably, become more likely the more a husband or wife feels their complaints go unheard or ignored

With time, the partner who is being flooded starts to see any and all problems in the marriage as severe and impossible to fix, since the flooding itself sabotages any attempt to work things out. As this continues it begins to seem useless to talk things over, and the partners try to soothe their troubled feelings on their own. They start leading parallel lives, essentially living in isolation from each other, and feel alone within the marriage

The study confirms that perturbing emotions are bad for health—to a degree.6 People who experienced chronic anxiety, long periods of sadness and pessimism, unremitting tension or incessant hostility, relentless cynicism or suspiciousness, were found to have double the risk of disease—including asthma, arthritis, headaches, peptic ulcers, and heart disease (each representative of major, broad categories of disease). This order of magnitude makes distressing emotions as toxic a risk factor as, say, smoking or high cholesterol are for heart disease —in other words, a major threat to health.

If the findings on emotions and health mean anything, it is that medical care that neglects how people feel as they battle a chronic or severe disease is no longer adequate. It is time for medicine to take more methodical advantage of the link between emotion and health. What is now the exception could—and should—be part of the mainstream, so that a more caring medicine is available to us all. At the least it would make medicine more humane. And, for some, it could speed the course of recovery. “Compassion,” as one patient put it in an open letter to his surgeon, “is not mere hand holding. It is good medicine.”57
